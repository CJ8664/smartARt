# SmartARt 

## A great way for chilren to have fun and at the same time, get some deep learning!

SmartARt is an intelligent game where kids can learn how to draw and use their artisty to achieve high scores. 
This game starts by asking the child draw a particular object on the blank canvas. Once the child completes his drawing, the game engine classifies the drawn image and tells the child whether his drawing matched the required topic. The child gets full credit if he draws the object correctly in the first attempt.
We also added 3D visualization of the particular object so that the child gets a better understanding of that particular object.
For extra points, we have a fun feature similar to a treasure hunt wherein the child has to explore his surroundings and look for that particular object and capture an image of that object. The game then classifies this image to determine whether the clicked photograph contains that particular object. A correct image gives the child extra points.
In the end, the total score is calculated through the stages in the game and it shows the child's performance. Additionally, this game has 
a difficulty feature where the user can decide how strict the classifier should be. The classifier is built in such a way that it will 
understand the child's version of an object, i.e., it overlooks lack of detail and crooked edges.
