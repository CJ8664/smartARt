# SmartARt 

## A fun game for kids to learn how to draw:

SmartARt is an intelligent game where kids can learn and practice drawing along with competing for high scores. 
This game lets the child draw the asked object. Once the child draws on the canvas, the game engine classifies the drawn image 
and tells the child whether his drawing was correct. The child gets full credit if he draws the object correctly in the first attempt.
We also added a 3D visualization of the particular object so that the child gets a better understanding of that particular object.
We also added a fun exploring feature similar to treasure hunt wherein the child has to look for that particular object 
in his surroundings and click an image of that object for extra points. The game engine then classifies this 
image to determine whether the clicked photograph contains that particular object. A correct image gives the child extra points.
In the end, the total score is calculated through the stages in the game and it shows your performance. Additionally, this game has 
a difficulty feature which determines how strict the classifier will be. The classifier is built in such a way that it will 
understand the child's version of an object. It overlooks lack of detail and crooked edges.
